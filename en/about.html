               No battle noise could be heard, only the
                                                  rippling waters of the nearby river. Even time
                                                  flowed more languidly now, or so it seemed in this
                                                  peaceful landscape. But everything was in flux in
                                                  the late summer of 1502, and not only in central
                                                  Italy. It was a time of rapid change, bold plans,
                                                  swift conquests, and breaking orders.
              </p>
<p>
               Was there nevertheless a deeper order hidden
                                                  behind all the turbulence, of the water and
                                                  perhaps also of the vicissitudes of human
                                                  history?
              </p>
<p>
               One had only to observe very carefully, and of
                                                  course record what one saw—no, to be able to
                                                  recreate from an understanding of the inner
                                                  efficacy of things, to be inventive in doing so,
                                                  perhaps even more inventive than nature itself,
                                                  always seizing the opportunities of the moment—but
                                                  all that was apparently not enough.
              </p>
<p>
               It was necessary not only to grasp the world in
                                                  its entirety, to make it one’s own, but also to
                                                  acquire its knowledge, all the knowledge,
                                                  including the lost knowledge of the Ancients, the
                                                  long-neglected knowledge that was now circulating
                                                  again in broader streams.
              </p>
<p>
               This was thanks to the obsessive hunters and
                                                  collectors of ancient texts; texts that had long
                                                  been gathering dust and decaying in old libraries
                                                  or attics but had now been given a new lease on
                                                  life, so that their authors were now
                                                  contemporaries with whom one could converse, one
                                                  could imitate, and, if possible, even surpass.
              </p>
<p>
               But to enter into conversation with them, one
                                                  had first to find them. After all, mechanics
                                                  helped the new technology of printing, yet another
                                                  prodigy of that art that so generously endowed the
                                                  age with inventions, both martial and peaceful,
                                                  and whose cornucopia was far from exhausted.
              </p>
<p>
               Being in exchange with the world did not only
                                                  mean socializing with other artists, architects,
                                                  engineers, and mechanics, nor simply feeling at
                                                  home in workshops and on construction sites. It
                                                  did not just mean impressing soldiers, army
                                                  commanders, diplomats, literati, and politicians
                                                  at courts and palaces with clever and elegant
                                                  speeches and promising plans and projects. Nor was
                                                  it enough to occasionally leave the cities to
                                                  wander through mountains and valleys and rural
                                                  towns like these, where one could quietly watch
                                                  birds fly, to consider whether this was not
                                                  perhaps another mechanical art that could be
                                                  surpassed.

               The notebook, whose cover might once have been
                                                  as light blue as the sky over the valley, was the
                                                  only companion on the walk that afternoon, a
                                                  silent yet eloquent counterpart, a mirror of time
                                                  that allowed one to converse with the past and
                                                  future self, and to which one could confide one’s
                                                  thoughts, even if no one else might yet understand
                                                  them:“The bird is a machine that works according
                                                  to mathematical laws.”
              </p>
<p>
               With whom might one speak about it? From whom
                                                  could one learn more about the secrets of
                                                  mechanics, wrapped as they are in the language of
                                                  mathematics, the most difficult but perhaps most
                                                  fruitful of all languages? The ancients had
                                                  probably mastered it best, and from them one could
                                                  learn more about the lost and to be regained
                                                  paradise of mechanics, where one could reap the
                                                  fruits of mathematics.

               Rapid change, conquests, and shifting rulers,
                                                  the hustle and bustle of such notorious
               <i>
                condottieri
               </i>
               as Cesare Borgia and Vitellozzo
                                                  Vitelli also had advantages for someone who was
                                                  not on a reckless hunt for power but rather for
                                                  knowledge. And who did not hesitate to seize the
                                                  moment, especially when it came to

                                                  Archimedes, the prince of mechanics, for his
                                                  endeavors. A short note in the booklet with the
                                                  light blue cover is intended to remind the future
                                                  self not to let opportunities pass by:
              </p>
<p>“Borges will get you the Archimedes of the
                                                  Bishop of Padua, Vitellozzo, the one that is in
                                                  Borgo San Sepolcro.”

                                                  ones, and building up a library was a bold

                                                  together to make the exhibition“Leonardo’s
                                                  Intellectual Cosmos” a new look at one of the most
                                                  fascinating figures in cultural history. So, enter
                                                  Leonardo’s Berlin library and welcome to his
                                                  intellectual cosmos!

               According to history of science, the practice
                                                  of craftsmanship and of art, and artists who were
                                                  also scientists, and scientists who were also
                                                  engineers—from Leonardo to Galileo—played a
                                                  decisive role in the emergence of modern science.
                                                  In the case of Leonardo, the main focus of
                                                  interest has been on his inventions and
                                                  technological visions. This has led to a distorted
                                                  image that ultimately denies him any deeper
                                                  intellectual context. But a systematic and careful
                                                  study of Leonardo’s manuscripts shows us an
                                                  artist, scholar, and scientist who had an intimate
                                                  relationship with books, culture, and the authors
                                                  of his time, as well as those of classical
                                                  antiquity.

               The exhibition is an adaptation of the
                                                  Florentine exhibition“Leonardo and his books: the
                                                  library of the universal genius,” curated by Carlo
                                                  Vecce and shown at the Museo Galileo from June to
                                                  September 2019. Due to the global coronavirus
                                                  crisis, the date for the Berlin exhibition had to
                                                  be postponed twice so far. I would like to take
                                                  this opportunity to thank all the organizers,
                                                  institutions, speakers, artists, and exhibition
                                                  guests for their patience and flexibility
                                                  throughout the planning process. As this volume
                                                  goes to press, the scheduled date for the opening,
                                                  May 10, 2021, falls in the year in which we
                                                  celebrate the 700th anniversary of the death of
                                                  Dante Alighieri, whose
               <i>
                Divine Comedy
               </i>
               formed
                                                  a significant reference point in Leonardo’s
                                                  intellectual cosmos. Pandemic situation
                                                  permitting, the exhibition will be open to
                                                  visitors from May 11 to June 28. The MPIWG will
                                                  accompany the exhibition with scholarly and public
                                                  activities and events. Rather than focusing on
                                                  Leonardo as a precursor to the modern
                                                  technological world, the exhibition honors his art
                                                  and science, his thought and practice, as part of
                                                  a distinct intellectual world. For Leonardo, this
                                                  included the endeavor to never separate theory
                                                  from practice and to perceive this world as a
                                                  whole, to constantly question its apparent fixed
                                                  points and thus keep it in constant motion.
              </p>
<p>
               A further goal of the exhibition project is to
                                                  illustrate the value of the far-reaching
                                                  intellectual networks and mutual connections that
                                                  have fostered the development of science and
                                                  culture since the early modern period. The
                                                  reconstruction of Leonardo’s library and its
                                                  presentation in the exhibition opens a new
                                                  perspective on Leonardo, showing him as an
                                                  intellectual and artist-scientist whose work was
                                                  only made possible by the diversity of such
                                                  connections and networks.
              </p>
<p>
               The exhibition places Leonardo’s library in the
                                                  context of the burgeoning book culture at the turn
                                                  from the 15

               centuries and illustrates the role this culture
                                                  played in his intellectual development and
                                                  creative process. While the scholarly work of
                                                  identifying the books by deciphering Leonardo’s
                                                  notes and lists can be considered almost complete,
                                                  the way in which these books were collected and
                                                  actually used in his library is still the subject
                                                  of debate and research.

               Looking back at the book culture of the
                                                  Gutenberg era is more relevant today than ever
                                                  before, confronted as we are with the challenges
                                                  of a new media revolution that makes it possible,
                                                  in principle, to make the accumulated knowledge of
                                                  humankind available to every single person. We are
                                                  still far from shaping an intellectual cosmos that
                                                  exploits this potential of the new media, and
                                                  instead run the risk of losing it in an
                                                  unmanageable fragmentation and amalgamation of
                                                  information and disinformation.

               Over the past two years, the exhibition project
                                                  has evolved into a multifaceted endeavor that, in
                                                  turn, could not have been realized without
                                                  wide-ranging networks and the cooperation,
                                                  support, and hard work of many institutions and
                                                  individuals who I will mention below.
              </p>
<p>
               First of all, I would like to thank our
                                                  long-time cooperation partner, the Museo Galileo,
                                                  especially its director, my friend of many years,
                                                  Paolo Galluzzi, and his entire team, particularly
                                                  Laura Manetti and Jacopo Tonini, who inspired us
                                                  to undertake this project. Their collaboration and
                                                  support from the beginning has laid the foundation
                                                  for all further developments. In addition,
                                                  Alessandro Nova from the Kunsthistorisches
                                                  Institut in Florence and Carlo Vecce from the
                                                  University of Naples have accompanied and
                                                  supported the project with their incredibly broad
                                                  knowledge of Leonardo—from the development of the
                                                  first idea to its realization in the exhibition.
                                                  We thank Paolo Galluzzi, Carlo Vecce, and
                                                  Alessandro Nova from the bottom of our hearts for
                                                  their continued support and commitment. Through

               Without the generous funding from our partners,
                                                  the NOMIS Foundation, this project would certainly
                                                  not have come about. We owe the contact to Barbara
                                                  Bludau, the former secretary general of the Max
                                                  Planck Society, and Reinhard Pöllath (Supervisory
                                                  Board of the Max Planck Foundation). We would like
                                                  to sincerely thank the representatives of the
                                                  NOMIS Foundation, Markus Reinhard and Ruben García
                                                  Santos, for their support and especially for
                                                  believing in the potential of the exhibition when
                                                  it was only a rough sketch on a sheet of paper.
                                                  Their flexibility and encouragement at all stages
                                                  of the project’s development have brought us to
                                                  where we are now.

               It is obvious that an exhibition of books is
                                                  inconceivable without the close cooperation and
                                                  support of the institutions that preserve them.
                                                  Our thanks here go to Hermann Parzinger, president
                                                  of the Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz (Prussian
                                                  Cultural Heritage Foundation), who has generously
                                                  encouraged the project from the outset. We would
                                                  like to give a special thanks to the
                                                  Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin (Berlin State Library)
                                                  and its director, Barbara Schneider-Kempf, as well
                                                  as to Gudrun Nelson-Busch, Falk Eisermann, and the
                                                  entire team. As curators, they have not only
                                                  identified and made the crucial books available
                                                  but have also generously supported the realization
                                                  of the exhibition and its opening events. Over the
                                                  past months, they have been our close
                                                  collaborative partners in all matters of
                                                  coordination, book restoration, and, of course,
                                                  the presentation of the books in the exhibition.
                                                  In this context, we would also like to thank our
                                                  colleagues at the Kupferstichkabinett (Museum of
                                                  Prints and Drawings) and the Kunstbibliothek der
                                                  Staatlichen Museen zu Berlin (Library of Art
                                                  History of the Berlin State Museums), who also
                                                  provided books that proved to be valuable
                                                  additions to the exhibition.
              </p>

               Given the overarching theme of commemorating
                                                  Leonardo da Vinci on the 500th anniversary of his
                                                  death, we have worked closely with the Italian
                                                  Embassy in Berlin. At this point, I would like to
                                                  sincerely thank His Excellency Ambassador—and
                                                  patron of the exhibition—Luigi Mattiolo, as well
                                                  as First Counsellor and Head of the Cultural and
                                                  Economic Section of the Embassy, Francesco Leone,
                                                  former Scientific Attaché Matteo Pardo and the
                                                  entire team at the Embassy for their partnership.
                                                  They were not only our partners in organizing the
                                                  Leonardo Symposium in April 2019, held at the
                                                  MPIWG and the Italian Embassy, but they generously
                                                  supported us in all phases of the project and in
                                                  all accompanying events.
              </p>
<p>
               Special thanks also go to the Governing Mayor
                                                  of Berlin, Michael Müller, for his contribution to
                                                  our Leonardo Symposium and his continuous support
                                                  in making the exhibition a reality, despite his
                                                  burden as a responsible politician in the
                                                  difficult times of the Corona pandemic.
              </p>

               The mastermind behind the exhibition design is
                                                  our architect Serge von Arx, who already shaped
                                                  our large Einstein exhibition in 2005. I would
                                                  like to express my deepest gratitude to him and
                                                  his team, especially also to Andreas Fuchs and
                                                  Armin Schreiter. We owe the exhibition in its
                                                  current form to their creative and tireless
                                                  work.

               In order to place Leonardo’s books in the
                                                  context of his life through exemplary objects, we
                                                  have embarked on a seemingly endless search for
                                                  suitable exhibits. At this point, I would like to
                                                  especially thank the director of the Museum für
                                                  Naturkunde (Natural History Musuem) Johannes Vogel
                                                  and his team, as well as Joachim Breuninger and
                                                  Kerstin Wallbach from the Stiftung Deutsches
                                                  Technikmuseum (German Museum of Technology), Felix
                                                  Lühning, Director of the Archenhold Observatory,
                                                  and again the colleagues from the Staatsbibliothek
                                                  zu Berlin and the Museo Galileo for their support,
                                                  which went far beyond providing key exhibits.
              </p>
<p>
               Last but not least, I would like to thank the
                                                  entire team at the MPIWG for their hard work on
                                                  this project, first and foremost Matteo
                                                  Valleriani, who not only played a major role in
                                                  shaping the exhibition concept but was also the
                                                  driving force in bringing its ideas to life. The
                                                  curatorial team also included Antonio Becchi,
                                                  whose knowledge of Leonardo and his work was of
                                                  crucial importance to our joint work, and Sabine
                                                  Hoffmann, whom I would like to thank especially
                                                  for producing the excellent texts that form the
                                                  link between the exhibits, the books, and
                                                  Leonardo’s scientific themes, and who thus played
                                                  a major role in bringing Leonardo’s intellectual
                                                  cosmos to life.

               Editing the catalogue in German and English was
                                                  in the proven hands of the Publication Manager of
                                                  Department I of the MPIWG, Lindy Divarci, who
                                                  mastered this Herculean task in record time with
                                                  assistance from Nina Bätzing, Elizabeth Hughes,
                                                  and Birgitta von Mallinckrodt. Mona Friedrich and
                                                  Lina Schwab mastered the planning and coordination
                                                  of the processes and the communication internally
                                                  and externally with aplomb. Nina Bätzing and
                                                  Vivienne Rischke contributed imaginatively to all
                                                  components of the exhibition, from the object
                                                  search to the bibliography to the design of
                                                  exhibits. Dirk Wintergrün and his team, in close
                                                  collaboration with the Museo Galileo team, have
                                                  created a virtual exhibition making Leonardo’s
                                                  Berlin library available online. On the part of
                                                  the MPIWG, Ohad Parnes, Hans-Jakob Ziemer, and
                                                  Jörg Fischer have worked diligently on
                                                  sponsorship, press relations, and the organization
                                                  of the 2019 Leonardo Symposium, not to mention
                                                  contracting. Thanks also go to the MPIWG
                                                  administration, whose work behind the scenes
                                                  cannot be underestimated. Finally, a very special
                                                  thank you goes to Sabine Bertram and the entire
                                                  library team led by Esther Chen. Without their
                                                  extremely thoughtful and dedicated help, there
                                                  would be no Berlin Leonardo Library. We would also
                                                  like to express our sincere thanks to Henrik Haak
                                                  (Fritz Haber Institute of the MPG) for his
                                                  technical support.

               Last but not least, we would like to thank
                                                  Claudio Pescio and his entire team at Giunti
                                                  Publishing, especially Dario Dondi, Lorenzo

             While referring to himself as an“unlettered
                                                  man,” Leonardo did not limit himself to learning
                                                  and accumulating knowledge only through the direct
                                                  study of natural phenomena. He devoted equal
                                                  attention to an intense dialogue with both ancient
                                                  and modern authors. With the passing of the years
                                                  he became not only a passionate reader, but also
                                                  an insatiable hunter of books and manuscripts. He
                                                  regarded these texts as precious maps which
                                                  indicated unexplored paths to knowledge that he
                                                  could follow to reach original insights and
                                                  awareness. By the time of his death, he owned
                                                  almost 200 works: an extraordinary library for a
                                                  15th-century artist-engineer, not only in terms of
                                                  quantity, but also for the variety of disciplines
                                                  covered. Leonardo carefully recorded these volumes
                                                  in his manuscripts to ensure that he could safely
                                                  retrieve them when he returned from one of the
                                                  many journeys undertaken during the course of his
                                                  lifetime.

             Unfortunately, the books and manuscripts
                                                  accumulated by Leonardo have disappeared without
                                                  trace. Only one exemplar of the texts that went
                                                  their various ways after his death has survived:

                                                  Laurenziana in Florence, on which Leonardo
                                                  registered 12 annotations.

                                                  Leonardo, the renowned Leonardo scholar, Carlo
                                                  Vecce, has reconstructed the contents of
                                                  Leonardo’s library. He has also provided valuable
                                                  information on the stages of Leonardo’s
                                                  acquisition of these complex resources with which
                                                  he maintained a constant and fruitful dialogue.
                                                  The results of this thorough investigation are
                                                  available to the international community of

                                                  constitutes a landmark in Leonardo studies. For
                                                  the first time, students of the Universal Man have
                                                  at their disposal an exhaustive list from which to
                                                  draw reliable information on the sources that
                                                  inspired him. Leonardo was never a passive reader;
                                                  he combined admiration for the authors of the
                                                  texts that intrigued him most with his instinctive
                                                  inclination to question their conclusions or to

                                                  in the publication of the above-mentioned volume.
                                                  It was first staged in the summer of 2019 by the
                                                  Museo Galileo in collaboration with the Commission

                                                  death of Leonardo da Vinci. From Florence, the

             Whereas Leonardo is known to the public primarily
                                                  for his artistic masterpieces, this exhibition
                                                  takes a look at his contemporaneity. Which works
                                                  did Leonardo read? What knowledge did he possess
                                                  when he embarked on his own studies? For answers
                                                  to these questions, the exhibition organizers have
                                                  reconstructed Leonardo’s library. Since Leonardo’s
                                                  own books are lost, they have assembled the Berlin
                                                  Leonardo Library from comparable contemporary
                                                  works. The volumes come from Berlin holdings,
                                                  especially from the Staatsbibliothek, but also
                                                  from the library of the Max Planck Institute for
                                                  the History of Science. They now bear witness to
                                                  the knowledge that made up Leonardo’s intellectual
                                                  cosmos.
            </p>
<p>
             The contrast between Leonardo’s books and his own
                                                  notes is particularly revealing. Leonardo’s
                                                  notebooks show the unfinished, experimental
                                                  super-richness of his work. A beautiful example is
                                                  offered by the first exhibit of the exhibition (1
                                                  σ). On this sheet, Leonardo presents geometry
                                                  exercises for the transformation of different
                                                  rectangles. Suddenly the argumentation breaks off
                                                  with a terse“
             <i>
              ecc.
             </i>
             ”
             <i>
</i>
             referring to a
                                                  possible, perhaps even intended, continuation of
                                                  the discourse. He also communicates the reason
                                                  that forces the sudden interruption:“
             <i>
              ecc.
                                                  perché la minestra si fredda
             </i>.” Because the
                                                  soup is getting cold, the studies will have to be
                                                  resumed at a later point in time—if they do not
                                                  turn to other subjects altogether.
            </p>
<p>
             Leonardo was less interested in specific objects
                                                  than in their transformation, dynamics, and
                                                  functionality. In his work, aesthetics and
                                                  mechanics are not opposites; they are mutually
                                                  dependent. What astonished me most was the
                                                  enormous precision with which he took notice of
                                                  complex dynamic systems. Drawings of the
                                                  turbulence of water, illustrated notes on the
                                                  flight of birds, and the unrealized bronze
                                                  sculpture of a rearing horse with rider are
                                                  outstanding examples of Leonardo’s stupendous
                                                  ability to observe and depict complex
                                                  movements.
            </p>
<p>
             Thanks to the exhibition, we can now trace the
                                                  intellectual cosmos that accompanied Leonardo’s
                                                  life journey. And human development is itself a
                                                  complex dynamic system. Therefore, neither the
                                                  reconstruction of Leonardo’s intellectual cosmos
                                                  nor psychoanalytical interpretations of his early
                                                  childhood can explain his uniqueness. Great talent
                                                  and favorable circumstances enabled a
                                                  self-reinforcing process that follows its own
                                                  laws. We, as an awed audience, are now given the
                                                  opportunity to follow it.

             The exhibition on the artist and scientific
                                                  genius Leonardo da Vinci, held in 2021 at the
                                                  Berlin State Library – Prussian Cultural Heritage

                                                  Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in
                                                  Berlin with the sponsorship of the Italian
                                                  ambassador, comes two years late; it was supposed
                                                  to commemorate the 500th anniversary of Leonardo’s
                                                  death in 2019. But it is never too late to engage
                                                  with the intellectual cosmos of this
             <i>

                                                  reconstruction of Leonardo’s library, which
                                                  provided the foundation and source of his
                                                  knowledge, creation, and discovery, makes up the
                                                  core of this exhibition. In this respect, there
                                                  really is no better place for this presentation
                                                  than the largest general scholarly library in the
                                                  German-speaking countries: the Berlin State

             The museums, libraries, and research institutes
                                                  of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation
                                                  possess world-class collections and holdings of
                                                  encyclopedic character. The fundamental break
                                                  between the Middle Ages and the modern era known
                                                  as the Renaissance, which particularly influenced
                                                  Leonardo, is represented by significant works in
                                                  the collections of the Berlin State Museums as
                                                  well as the Berlin State Library. Only Leonardo da
                                                  Vinci is missing: the Foundation owns neither
                                                  manuscripts nor incunabula nor noteworthy early
                                                  printings, nor any works of art that can be
                                                  conclusively attributed to him. Then again,
                                                  original copies from his reference library have
                                                  not been preserved anywhere else either; and so
                                                  the only course of action is to collect the texts
                                                  that he must have owned and that may have
                                                  influenced him, even if the copies and editions
                                                  shown here have no direct connection to the
                                                  master.

             Wilhelm von Bode believed he could fill this gap
                                                  in 1909, at least for the collections of the
                                                  Berlin State Museums, when he acquired a wax bust
                                                  of the Roman goddess of flowers, Flora, for the
                                                  Kaiser Friedrich Museum (now the Bode Museum) and
                                                  attributed it to Leonardo da Vinci. After it was
                                                  made public, however, this purchase provoked an
                                                  unprecedented scandal in the press regarding the
                                                  sculpture’s attribution, a discussion that still
                                                  holds art historians in its thrall today, though
                                                  far more than 700 articles, studies, and
                                                  investigations have already tackled the topic.
                                                  Leonardo is thus an object of interest for the
                                                  Berlin collections of the Prussian Cultural
                                                  Heritage Foundation mainly because of the question
                                                  of whether he is represented in them or not; much
                                                  evidence speaks for the latter.

             Leonardo da Vinci remains an exceptional figure
                                                  in the history of European art and science. But
                                                  his brilliant universality is reminiscent of a
                                                  famous Berliner whose 250th birthday fell in the
                                                  same year as the 500th anniversary of Leonardo’s
                                                  death: Alexander von Humboldt. Both are rightly
                                                  regarded as polymaths and untiring geniuses,
                                                  though the one was more of an artist and the other
                                                  more of an explorer. Each lived in the most
                                                  important political, economic, and intellectual
                                                  metropolis of his time, in the wake of profound
                                                  upheavals: Leonardo in Florence after Savonarola’s
                                                  reign of terror, Alexander in Paris after the
                                                  French Revolution. Both encountered the most
                                                  important rulers of their time: Leonardo met
                                                  Cesare Borgia, the pope and the French king;
                                                  Alexander met the Prussian kings Frederick Wilhelm
                                                  III and IV, Thomas Jefferson, and Napoleon. Both
                                                  were path-breaking inventors: Leonardo developed
                                                  diving suits and a variety of futuristic machines,
                                                  while Alexander created mine lamps and breathing
                                                  devices. Both believed in the beauty of nature and
                                                  the unity of humans and nature, and both described
                                                  and drew plants and animals. Both were active as
                                                  geologists and geographers: Leonardo took interest
                                                  in clouds and the tides in the Black Sea and
                                                  Caspian Sea, while Alexander looked to the
                                                  Humboldt Current and other natural phenomena in
                                                  Latin America. And both wrote their observations
                                                  and discoveries down in diaries that they added to
                                                  constantly: Leonardo in his famed
             <i>
              codici
             </i>,
                                                  notebooks that he wore on his belt; Alexander in
                                                  the diaries that he constantly had at hand on his
                                                  voyages of discovery. And this reveals what may be
                                                  their most important difference: while Leonardo’s
             <i>
              codici
             </i>
             are largely scattered today,
                                                  Alexander von Humboldt’s travel diaries and other
                                                  holdings are preserved in the Berlin State Library
                                                  in exemplary fashion, indexed and made available
                                                  for research.

             Memory institutions and archives of knowledge
                                                  such as the State Library and other organs of the
                                                  Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation once again
                                                  have demonstrated their potential when it comes to
                                                  making the achievements of unique and significant
                                                  artists and scholars of previous eras
                                                  comprehensible, placing them in the context of
                                                  their times and thereby allowing them to speak to
                                                  us, bringing them to life for us. This exhibition
                                                  is an impressive confirmation of the feats of
                                                  transmission that memory institutions are capable
                                                  of performing. Doing so, however, also requires
                                                  bringing together differing and complementary
                                                  abilities. Thus, it proved fortunate that the Max
                                                  Planck Institute for the History of Science came
                                                  together with the Berlin State Library—Prussian
                                                  Cultural Heritage Foundation for this fruitful
                                                  collaboration. The initiators of the exhibition
                                                  and all of those who made it possible deserve our
                                                  thanks for making Leonardo da Vinci and his impact
                                                  on his era accessible to us in a completely new
                                                  and very special way.

             How particularly suitable for an exhibition on
                                                  Leonardo’s intellectual cosmos is the
                                                  Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin (State Library) with
                                                  its site on the Kulturforum. By definition, a
                                                  library is above all the physical manifestation of
                                                  a spiritual world, basically its embodiment.
                                                  What’s more, were he alive today, Leonardo would
                                                  certainly feel very much at ease in the
                                                  Staatsbibliothek. Here he would find literature
                                                  for his studies of architecture, geometry, statics
                                                  and dynamics, anatomy, and mathematics. He would
                                                  only have to take a brief walk across the street
                                                  to have a look at paintings by the great talents
                                                  of his time, and discover further locations for
                                                  his work at the Kupferstichkabinett (Museum of
                                                  Prints and Drawings) and the Kunstbibliothek
                                                  (Library of Art History), which also happen to
                                                  have contributed to his exhibition. Widening the
                                                  circle, Berlin is a city where science and
                                                  technology, along with art give ample grounds for
                                                  cooperation between research institutes,
                                                  libraries, and museums, providing a solid basis
                                                  from which to consider the thought of one of the
                                                  most famous polymaths in cultural and intellectual
                                                  history.

             Despite all the modernity that we like to ascribe
                                                  to the very early originators of technical
                                                  concepts first realized centuries later and all
                                                  connections to the present that can be
                                                  demonstrated, we must keep in mind that
                                                  researching during the Renaissance posed
                                                  challenges unknown to us today. A private library
                                                  such as the one that Leonardo called his own was
                                                  in no way to be taken for granted. That makes it
                                                  all the more exciting to reconstruct the library
                                                  by using surviving book lists. Even if very little
                                                  of Leonardo’s collection was preserved, this
                                                  presentation, which relies to the greatest degree
                                                  possible on editions available then, gives insight
                                                  into the foundations available to Leonardo.

             Taking the image of today’s science as“sitting
                                                  on the shoulders of giants,” Leonardo is
                                                  undisputedly one of those giants who have shaped
                                                  and influenced science for more than 500 years
                                                  since his death. The recreation of his library in
                                                  the exhibition and in this catalogue makes clear,
                                                  however, that this giant was already sitting on
                                                  the shoulders of others.

                                                  important manuscripts and prints from our
                                                  collection, and last but not least the expertise
                                                  of our specialists, in order to play a significant
                                                  role in this cooperation with the Max Planck

             When we think of Leonardo da Vinci, the term“universal genius” springs to mind, by which we
                                                  mean a highly talented person whose intellect can
                                                  move flexibly between various disciplines,
                                                  creatively combining various forms of knowledge.
                                                  In this context, the word“universal” also
                                                  acquires a second, geographical meaning that is
                                                  derived from the first: a universal genius quickly
                                                  becomes an international intellectual figure who
                                                  is recognized worldwide precisely because their
                                                  actions are innovative and influential.

             As the Italian ambassador, this second
                                                  significance of Leonardo da Vinci as a universal
                                                  genius is just as important to me as the first,
                                                  because it highlights his international impact as
                                                  a historical figure. This is made particularly
                                                  clear in the exhibition“Leonardo’s Intellectual
                                                  Cosmos”: even in his time, the intellectual
                                                  constellation in which Leonardo moved was
             <i>
              international

             Leonardo’s works and discoveries were
             <i>
              internationally
             </i>
             recognized and are admired
                                                  today throughout the world, in Milan and Florence
                                                  just as in Paris, London, and St. Petersburg. This
                                                  exhibition is also
             <i>

             </i>
             itself,
                                                  because it is the result of international
             <i>
              cooperation
             </i>, particularly between Italian
                                                  and German cultural institutions. It is based on
                                                  the research of Prof. Carlo Vecce of the
                                                  Università L’Orientale in Naples and was first
                                                  opened at the Museo Galileo in Florence in
                                                  cooperation with the Max Planck Institute for the
                                                  History of Science (MPIWG) Berlin. Thanks to the
                                                  engagement of the Museo Galileo and the MPIWG, the
                                                  exhibition went on tour and can now also be seen
                                                  at the Berlin State Library. We are deeply
                                                  thankful for the engagement of all of those
                                                  involved during this difficult pandemic, at a time
                                                  when all forms of international cooperation in the
                                                  cultural sector are confronted with once
                                                  unthinkable obstacles and limitations—particularly
                                                  when it comes to organizing a physical exhibition.
                                                  Under these conditions, this initiative is a brave
                                                  gesture and a hopeful signal for the world of
                                                  culture.

             For this reason, I am particularly proud that the
                                                  Italian Embassy in Berlin supported this
                                                  undertaking from its inception, on April 10, 2019,
                                                  when the Berlin exhibition was announced for 2020
                                                  at the MPIWG conference“Leonardo da Vinci. An
                                                  Inquisitive Man: Technologist, Scientist and
                                                  Artist.” Due to the pandemic, it had to be delayed
                                                  until 2021, which is why it now falls in the same
                                                  year as another important date, the 700th
                                                  anniversary of the death of Dante Alighieri, one
                                                  of Leonardo’s great masters who was certainly
                                                  represented in the library of this“not well-read
                                                  man” (as Leonardo mocked himself because he could
                                                  not read Latin). What historical figure embodies
                                                  Dante’s famed verses from canto 26 of
             <i>
              Inferno
             </i>
             better than the autodidact
                                                  Leonardo:“Considerate la vostra semenza: Fatti
                                                  non foste a viver come bruti, / ma per seguir
                                                  virtute e canoscenza”? (“Consider how your souls
                                                  were sown: you were not made to live like brutes
                                                  or beasts / but to pursue virtue and
                                                  knowledge”—translation by Robert Hollander and
                                                  Jean Hollander). Let us take this symbolic passing
                                                  of the torch as a good omen.

<p>“Leonardo’s Intellectual Cosmos” consists not
                                                  only of physical items on display—his books and
                                                  manuscripts, as well as the reconstruction of his

             Under the current conditions, there is an urgent
                                                  demand for new solutions in our knowledge economy.
                                                  This exhibition helps us to approach this question
                                                  because it shows us how the field of the
             <i>
              digital humanities
             </i>
             can contribute to
                                                  enhancing and spreading our knowledge, and it
                                                  demonstrates that the expertise of historians and
                                                  philologists is indispensable. It brings together
                                                  international experts on the Florentine
                                                  Renaissance and the most renowned European
                                                  institutions in the field of the digital
                                                  humanities. This complementary use of traditional
                                                  philological methods on the one hand and the
                                                  newest digital means on the other helps us not
                                                  only to better comprehend the past in which
                                                  Leonardo lived and worked, but also to recognize
                                                  how our knowledge will be shaped and shared in the
                                                  future.

             For months, we have been living in uncertain
                                                  times whose consequences are to be felt in all
                                                  areas of life.

                                                  just as deeply affected by the pandemic as
                                                  start-ups and businesses. For public health
                                                  reasons, many of them are currently only
                                                  accessible in a limited way, if at all. This
                                                  delays or even prevents the work of many
                                                  historians, philologists, political scientists,
                                                  and sociologists, whose research contributes to
                                                  public discourse. If we go for long without their
                                                  valuable contributions, it may have grave
                                                  long-term effects for public democratic debate in
                                                  our countries.

             But what if this crisis situation spurs us to
                                                  solve problems that also existed before the
                                                  pandemic? Let it be mentioned that Leonardo
                                                  himself survived the 1484 outbreak of the plague
                                                  in Milan. This experience prompted him to think
                                                  about how quality of life in the city could be
                                                  improved. And so he developed the first concept
                                                  for a garbage removal service in Milan. In more
                                                  recent times, the project of European integration
                                                  arose from awareness of the horrors of the 20th
                                                  century. Times of crisis have always been the
                                                  driving force behind innovation. The highest

             have
                                                  quickly recognized the need for innovation and
                                                  made the corresponding financial means available
                                                  for digitization in the cultural sector.

             What would the universal genius Leonardo da Vinci
                                                  have done in a similar situation? We will never
                                                  know the answer to that question, and it wouldn’t
                                                  make sense to speculate about it, especially in
                                                  this highly advanced scientific context. However,
                                                  we can learn from the example of how Leonardo
                                                  approached the new media of his day: at that time,
                                                  the printing press was still a relatively new
                                                  technology that came to Italy from Germany at the
                                                  end of the 15th century, when Leonardo was a
                                                  rising young artist completing his apprenticeship.
                                                  Thanks to the printing press, books became more
                                                  affordable and accessible. Without this invention,
                                                  Leonardo could hardly have had access to the
                                                  knowledge of antiquity and of his era, to say
                                                  nothing of the possibility of building a private
                                                  library with the then-impressive number of
                                                  approximately 200 books. And so he is what we
                                                  might now call a“print native.” He never
                                                  hesitated to take advantage of the opportunities
                                                  provided by the newest technological
                                                  achievements—and with this intellectual attitude
                                                  he remains a model for us today.

             NOMIS, a private Swiss foundation, strives to“create a spark” in the world of science by
                                                  enabling, funding and supporting pioneering
                                                  research in the natural and social sciences as
                                                  well as the humanities. Hereby, NOMIS aims to
                                                  serve as a catalyst for scientific and human
                                                  progress by fostering interdisciplinary research,
                                                  establishing collaborative research networks and
                                                  developing strategic partnerships.

             A master of interdisciplinary study himself,
                                                  Leonardo da Vinci was a pioneer in the
                                                  co-evolution of science, technology, and the arts.
                                                  His intense curiosity led him down a vast array of
                                                  intertwining intellectual paths as he strove to
                                                  make connections in all aspects of nature and our
                                                  human existence. Navigating seemingly disparate
                                                  disciplines was a lifelong personal quest that
                                                  would lead to significant new insights about our
                                                  world.

             Leonardo and his work exemplify the kind of
                                                  curiosity-driven, pioneering researchers and novel
                                                  inquiries that inspire and drive the NOMIS
                                                  Foundation. Supporting the development of the
                                                  virtual library of Leonardo’s private collection
                                                  of books—a collection that served as the source of
                                                  much of Leonardo’s vast knowledge—was thus an
                                                  irrefutable means for NOMIS to advance our mission
                                                  of enabling curiosity-driven interdisciplinary
                                                  research endeavors.

             We are very excited about the Leonardo’s
                                                  Intellectual Cosmos project and to be witness to
                                                  the incredible collaborative effort with the Max
                                                  Planck Institute for the History of Science—an
                                                  institution that shares NOMIS’ high regard for
                                                  fundamental, interdisciplinary research—as well as
                                                  the Berlin State Library and the Museo Galileo, to
                                                  name just a few of the organizations behind this
                                                  remarkable undertaking. Together, as we explore
                                                  Leonardo’s role in the history of knowledge, we
                                                  are discovering the innumerable connections in the
                                                  world and realizing the significance of continued
                                                  interdisciplinary research in our pursuit of
                                                  answers to the important questions and challenges
                                                  facing humanity today.
